              <h3>Dear Valued Customers, Suppliers, Friends,</h3></br>
              <h4>The 2nd Annual Akron Foundry / Akron Electric Robert A. Sik Memorial Golf Outing will take place on Saturday, June 16, 2018. Bob was an integral part of our company and an avid golfer. Our very first outing was almost 30 years ago at Paradise Lake, followed by Raintree, and finally to our current venue, Mayfair Country Club. While the venue and guests have changed over the years, a great day of golf remains. We are honored to continue this tradition in his name.</h4>
              <h4>Last year’s event was an overwhelming success in a large part to you! Without the generosity of our vendors, customers, and friends, this outing would not be nearly as rewarding. We, the employees of Akron Foundry Company and Akron Electric, are proud of the relationship we share with you, one demonstrated by your generosity. A traditional part of this event is awarding prizes donated by our vendors, customers, and friends. We understand if you are unable, but any contribution would be very much appreciated! You and your company will, of course, be acknowledged at the outing.</h4>
              <h4>The cost to golf, which will include 18 holes with a cart, beverages, and some phenomenal food throughout the day, will be $100.00/golfer. We are also seeking generous suppliers to sponsor holes for $100.00 each to offset the cost of beverages and golf for our mutual customers and friends. For the true hackers amongst us, we will be selling Mulligans for $5.00 each. Only one per person, four per team! We will also sell Skins for $5.00 each – also one per player, four per team.</h4>
              <h4>Please register on this site ASAP to guarantee a spot in our schedule. This is historically a sold out event, so please register immediately. Registration fees must be paid prior to the day of the outing. To speed up the morning registration process, Mulligans and Skins may also be paid for in advance.</h4>
              <h4>Please pay by Friday June 15, 2018.</h4>
