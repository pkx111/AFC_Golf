          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Dear Valued Customers, Suppliers, Friends,</p>
          <p>The 2nd Annual Akron Foundry / Akron Electric Robert A. Sik Memorial Golf Outing will take place on Saturday, June 16, 2018. Bob was an integral part of our company and an avid golfer as many of you well know. We are honored to continue this tradition in his name.</p>
          <p>The cost to golf, which will include 18 holes with a cart, beverages, and some phenomenal food throughout the day will be $100.00/golfer. We are also seeking generous suppliers to sponsor holes for $100.00 per hole to offset the cost of beverages and golf for our mutual customers.</p>
          <p>Suppliers - A traditional part of this event is awarding prizes donated by our vendors. We, the employees of Akron Foundry Company and Akron Electric, are proud of the relationship we share with you, one demonstrated by your generosity. We understand if you are unable to contribute, but your help would be very much appreciated. Your company will, of course, be acknowledged at the outing. </p>
          <p>Please register on this site ASAP to guarantee your spot in our schedule. This has always been a sold out event, so please register immediately. Registration fees must be paid prior to the day of the outing.</p>
          <p>Please pay by Friday June 15, 2018.</p>
